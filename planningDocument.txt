#where i am starting trying to think like a client to figure out the requirements before starting an erd then the sql itself.
i want this database to store all my recepies.
i need it to have information about the ingredients, the equipment used, the steps of the recepie and other nescessary details.
i want it to have information about measurements so i can use a program to change the serving sizes, or to be able to switch between cups and milliliters etc.
Ingredients: 
  i need it to be able to give me a list at the start of which ingredients are needed and how much
  i want it to be able to give me nutrition information ie calories macros so i can later make it work out the rough nutrition info of the recepies themselves
  where the ingredients are stored: fridge, freezer, pantry
  if the ingredients are: solids, powders, liquids?
equipment:
  i want it to give me a list of equipment nescessary at the start
steps:
  i want it to 
other:
  prep time, cooking time, serving size, 
  i want to classify the recepies based off what sort of meal it is: breakfast, drink, desert, snack, side, main, sauce
  i want to classify the recepies based off what the main ingredient is: bread, rice, potato, beef, pork, chicken, vegetables, baking?, other
  i would like an image saved for each recepie
  a small txt description of what the recepie is
  

tables needed:
  recepies (m:m with ingredients and with equipment tables)
    primary key id   integer (automatically just counts up rather than having to program one each for them)
    name string
    description   string
    type of meal  string
    main ingredient   string
    prep time   time? or float(number with decimal places)
